## Reflection and Refraction

Reflection first. The surface now reflects the spheres.

Refraction in action. We can see how the glass sphere bends the light.

Why the bottom part of the glass sphere is black? That's because the glass sphere inverts the scene, the black part is actually the black "sky" above. In other words, when we look at the glass sphere, we see an upside-down mini version of the scene.

Here's a better scene to showcase refraction with two opaque spheres behind one large transparent sphere (we can call it a crystal ball).
